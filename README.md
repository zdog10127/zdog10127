With over 3 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to dive into various projects, applying and exploring different tools and technologies.

In this role, I took on the responsibility of coordinating a team of developers, focusing on strategic solutions and ensuring efficient project delivery. This experience broadened my ability to solve complex problems and gave me a comprehensive perspective on how to lead projects with a focus on high-quality results.
